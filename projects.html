            <h3>Local Restaurant Website </h3>
            <p>
                Description: To test my newfound knowledge I built a vibrant restaurant website harnessing the power of JavaScript, React, NodeJS, and Express to create a user-friendly interface. Leveraging Axios and Sequelize, I ensured seamless communication between front and back ends, while meticulously managing database interactions.

                Technologies Used: JavaScript, React, NodeJS, Express, Axios, CSS, CORS, HTML, Sequelize

                GitHub Repository: <a href="https://github.com/yogurlval/Specializations_Capstone" target="_blank">Restaurant Project</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                In this project, I developed a dynamic and responsive full stack website for a local restaurant, implementing a user-friendly front-end using React, offering an intuitive and visually appealing interface for customers to browse the restaurant's menu and services. I designed a custom database structure using Sequelize, ensuring efficient data management and secure storage of customer information, orders, and restaurant details. In addition, I collaborated closely with the restaurant owners to incorporate their branding and vision into the website, resulting in a cohesive online presence that aligns with the restaurant's identity.

            <h3>MadLibs Website</h3>
            <p>
                Description: As a demonstration of my skills in both front-end and back-end development, I created a Madlibs website using JavaScript on the front-end and employed the following technologies on the back-end: Axios, CORS, and Express.js.
                <br>
                <br>
                Technologies Used: Axios, CORS, Express.js, HTML, CSS
                <br>
                <br>
                GitHub Repository: <a href="https://github.com/yogurlval/FoundationsCapstone" target="_blank">MadLibs Project</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                In this project, I put my skills to the test to create an interactive and engaging Madlibs game. Users are prompted to input various parts of speech, such as nouns, adjectives, and verbs. Upon submission, the inputs are sent to the server using Axios, and the back-end built with Express.js processes the data and generates a hilarious Madlibs story. The website is styled using HTML and CSS to provide an aesthetically pleasing user interface.</p>
